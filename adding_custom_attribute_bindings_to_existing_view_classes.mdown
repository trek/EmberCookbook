# Adding Custom `attributeBindings` to Existing View Classes

## Problem
You want to use an attribute binding that is missing on an existing Ember.View class having to subclass the view.

## Solution
Reopen the class with `reopen` and append the HTML attribute name you would like to expose through bindings
